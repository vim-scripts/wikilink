"WikiLink" is a Vim plugin which eases the navigation between files  in a personnal wiki.

 Links syntax currently supported follows Github's Gollum (https://github.com/github/gollum)
 ie [[My link|My displayed link]]

 This plugin also detects footerbar and sidebar files and splits the window
 accordingly (again, see Gollum for syntax)

Usage
 -----
  Hit the ENTER key when the cursor is on a wiki link
  The corresponding file is loaded in the current buffer
 
  Hit Shift + ENTER to go back
